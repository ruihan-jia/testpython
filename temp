There was no significant difference in the k value of total Kv currents (control, 24.6 ± 1.1 mV; SNL+vehicle, 22.3 ± 0.6 mV; SNL+UNC0638, 21.1 ± 0.8 mV), A-type Kv currents (control, 19.6 ± 1.9 mV; SNL+vehicle, 13.7 ± 1.3 mV; SNL+UNC0638, 15.1 ± 1.5 mV) and non-A-type Kv currents (control, 25.0 ± 0.5 mV; SNL+vehicle, 24.3 ± 0.4 mV; SNL+UNC0638, 24.7 ± 1.3 mV) between the three groups.
